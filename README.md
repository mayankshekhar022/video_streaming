WebRTC is a technology that allows real-time communication between two or more devices over the Internet. It can be used to create video calling, voice calling, and messaging applications. MERN is a popular stack for building web applications. It consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.
The first step is to create a simple chat application. We will use the following tech Stack:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database

Express: A web framework

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment

This is the folder structure we will use in the project:

# Video Streaming App

This project is a video streaming application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with support for one-on-one and group video calls.

A little explanation about the modules we installed:

Nodemon: runs in development mode, whenever you make changes to your code and save, it restarts our server.
Babel/core: contains the Node API and requires hook.
Express: minimal Node.js framework that uses an abstraction layer to perform operations such as creating a server and handling routes.
Body-parser: Body parsing middleware to parse incoming request bodies to pass to our routes.
Dotenv: module that loads production-sensitive data (database connection links, passwords, etc) in form of variables into the application.
Mongoose: ODM for performing transactions with MongoDB.
Socket.io: module that helps to set up a Socket.IO server for accepting and broadcasting messages to connected clients.
